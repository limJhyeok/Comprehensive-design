## **Overview**
This project focuses on determining the optimal locations for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in the Michuhol district of Incheon, South Korea. The objective is to minimize travel and waiting times for EV users, improving accessibility and convenience.

The project combines geospatial analysis and optimization techniques, including genetic algorithms, to identify ideal locations for rapid EV charging stations.

## **Motivation**
Electric vehicles are key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. However, the expansion of charging infrastructure is vital to support the increasing adoption of EVs. This study addresses the problem of identifying optimal locations for EV charging stations based on various criteria, including population density, proximity to existing stations, and points of interest.

## **Methodology**
The project integrates geospatial data processing and optimization using Python. It uses:
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Spatial data of Michuhol district.
   - Existing charging station locations.
   - Population and building density data.

2. **Geospatial Analysis**:
   - Conversion of spatial data to uniform coordinate systems (EPSG:5179).
   - Visualization of current charging station locations and candidate points using `matplotlib` and `geopandas`.

3. **Optimization with Genetic Algorithms**:
   - **Initialization**: Random generation of candidate points within the Michuhol district.
   - **Evaluation**: Scoring candidate points based on proximity to population centers and existing stations.
   - **Selection**: Fitness-based selection of candidate points using a roulette-wheel approach.
   - **Crossover & Mutation**:
      - Crossover: Generate new candidates within the vicinity of high-performing points.
      - Mutation: Random generation of candidate points within the Michuhol district.
   - **Iteration**: Repeat until convergence or maximum iterations are reached.


## **Key Steps in the Code**
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load shapefile for Michuhol district.
   - Import existing charging station data and geocode it using `geopandas`.

2. **Random Point Generation**:
   - Create random candidate points within the district polygon using `shapely`.

3. **Fitness Evaluation**:
   - Calculate distances between candidate points and population centers.
   - Assign weights to criteria like distance, population density, and POIs.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Use `matplotlib` to visualize current and proposed charging station locations.

5. **Genetic Algorithm**:
   - Apply mutation and crossover to refine candidate points.

## **Usage**
### **Required Libraries**
Install the following Python libraries:
- `geopandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `shapely`

### **Execution**
1. Place the required datasets (`.shp` files and Excel sheets) in the working directory.
2. Execute the Python script. The script will:
   - Visualize current and candidate station locations.
   - Perform genetic algorithm-based optimization.
   - Output the best candidate locations.

### **Input Data**
- **Spatial Data**: Michuhol district boundaries (`미추홀구.shp`).
- **Charging Station Data**: Existing EV charging station locations.
- **Normalized Data**: Factors affecting optimality (population, building density, etc.).

### **Outputs**
- Visualizations of candidate and selected charging station locations.
- Optimal station coordinates.

## **Results**
The algorithm identifies optimal locations for new EV charging stations, considering travel distance minimization and demand hotspots. Visual outputs include maps displaying the evolution of candidate points and final station placements.
